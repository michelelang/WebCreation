        <h1 class="header">WebCreation.co Terms of Service</h1>
        <h3 class="midHeader">Date last updated: 2018</h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>WebCreation.co starts working on a project upon receipt of a down payment. Unless otherwise specified in writing,
            the client is charged the remaining balance upon completion of the project. Websites are made live upon completion
            of the project, when all payments are cleared. If applicable, hosting and domain name registration fees must
            be paid every month. </li>
          <li>Additional services come at additional fees, on a fee for service basis or on an hourly rate. If clients require
            additional services, the correspondent fee is added to their invoice and they are charged accordingly. </li>
          <li>Delays in project completion may occur when:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>There is a delay in any payments</li>
            <li>The client requests further changes in the design, structure, or content of the project</li>
            <li>The client purchases an additional service related to the project</li>
            <li>There is a delay in the receipt of any materials from the client </li>
            <li>Time frame estimates are approximate only and are subject to change at any time at WebCreation.co’s discretion.
              At any time, and at its whole discretion, WebCreation.co may decide to put a project on hold.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>All of our services are 100% satisfactory guaranteed. However, WebCreation.co will under no circumstances be held
            responsible to satisfy unreasonable expectations or requests. WebCreation.co will decide whether or not a request
            or an expectation is reasonable or lies within the scope of offer of services to its client. As an example, if
            the client purchases a certain service, but in order to be fully satisfied, WebCreation.co judges that an additional
            service is necessary, then it is no longer WebCreation.co’s responsibility or commitment to satisfy the client.
            In other words, WebCreation.co guarantees 100% satisfaction within the framework of its original agreement with
            the client, according to WebCreation.co’s understanding.</li>
          <li>Services or part of services (i.e. elements of a project) that have been approved by the client are considered
            as services with which the client is 100% satisfied. Any further work on these services (elements of the project)
            will be invoiced accordingly. </li>
          <li>Unless clearly specified otherwise, all project statuses are set as “completed” after the website handover with
            the client. This means no more work will be done on that project and no service will be provided. This doesn’t
            apply to hosting and domain registration services, which are provided independently of the project status, only
            according to the client’s package and payments. </li>
          <li>WebCreation.co always prevents unauthorized access, maintains data accuracy, and ensures the correct use of information,
            through appropriate physical, electric, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure information it collects
            online and offline.</li>
          <li>All prices appearing on this site and WebCreation.co materials, are subject to change without notice. These prices
            are solely informative and WebCreation.co is not necessarily committed to them for your project (software tools,
            hosting servers, domain registration, etc. can fluctuate in price). To receive a free quote for your project,
            please email us at
            <a href="mailto:info@webcreation.co">info@webcreation.co</a>
          </li>
          <li>WebCreation.co does not assume any responsibility or liability for the content of the website it designs, develops,
            and/or markets. WebCreation.co has no control over any information, materials, or products found thereon. WebCreation.co
            does not serve as a consultant for its clients, and they are entirely responsible for all that is found on their
            websites. </li>
          <li>Because of the nature of web design and programming work, websites always appear differently on different computers.
            Screen resolution, operating system, and browsing software are just a few examples of variables that may affect
            the way a website looks. The client must be aware of these possible variations and WebCreation.co will not be
            held responsible for them. </li>
        </ol>
